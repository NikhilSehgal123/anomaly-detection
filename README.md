***Solution Brief***
Using Azure Anomaly Detector, we have built a solution that can spot anomalies in physiological data. Spotting anomalies in physiological data is important because it can be informative of signs of health deterioration. This can be used to detect early signs of disease and can be used to improve the quality of life of patients.
